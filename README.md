# 🚀 C++ Basics – Foundational Programs

This repository is a personal collection of C++ programs aimed at exploring and understanding the core fundamentals of the C++ programming language. It emphasizes **clarity**, **hands-on practice**, and **progressive learning**.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Input and output operations  
- Data types and variables  

> *(More topics coming soon — see [🧠 Future Additions](#-future-additions))*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is intended to:
- Reinforce the basics of C++ through concise, focused examples  
- Help beginners gain confidence in writing and debugging C++ code  
- Act as a reference point and revision toolkit for foundational concepts  

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

- Clone or fork the repository  
- Open it in any C++ IDE or **Replit** (recommended for cloud usage)  
- Browse the `src/` directory for `.cpp` files  
- Use the `.run.sh` script on Replit to select and run programs interactively  
- Try modifying programs or adding your own examples to strengthen your understanding  

---

## 🧠 Future Additions

The repository will gradually expand to include:

- Operators and expressions  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)  
- Looping constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
- Functions and parameter passing  
- Arrays and basic memory layout  
- Introduction to pointers  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) fundamentals  
- File handling and streams  
- Basic data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues)  
- Practical mini-projects for hands-on application

## 🔧 Developer Utilities

> These are helper scripts used during development on Replit. Viewers can safely ignore them.

- `.run.sh` – Select and run any C++ file from the `src/` directory. It compiles the file and runs the output from `executables/` folder.  
- `.push.sh` – Automates Git workflows. Prompts for file and commit message, then adds, commits, and pushes changes in one step.

## 🙏 Credits

While all programs are written from scratch for learning purposes, this project takes inspiration from popular online tutorials.  
Special thanks to **Bro Code** for an excellent [C++ Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1zzTwrIg), which served as a foundational learning path.
