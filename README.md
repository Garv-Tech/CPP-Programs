# 🚀 C++ Basics – Foundational Programs

This repository is a personal collection of C++ programs designed to explore and understand the fundamentals of the C++ programming language. It focuses on clarity, practice, and step-by-step learning.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Input and Output operations
- Data types and variables

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Strengthen the basics of C++ with simple, focused examples
- Build confidence in writing and running C++ code
- Serve as a reference and revision material for core concepts

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

- Clone the repo or download the files  
- Open in any C++-compatible IDE or Replit  
- Run and modify each file to understand how the logic works  
- Use this as a sandbox to experiment and learn

---

## 🧠 Future Additions

- Operators and expressions
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Looping constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Functions and parameter handling
- Arrays and basic memory layout
- Introduction to pointers and addresses
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling and streams
- Basic data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues)
- Practical mini-projects

## 🛠 Developer Notes

This project contains hidden utility scripts to streamline development in Replit:

- `.run.sh` — Allows compiling and running any C++ file by selecting it from a list, making testing efficient without manually updating the run command each time.  
- `.push.sh` — A helper script to automate Git commands. It prompts for the file/folder to add and commit message, then adds, commits, and pushes to GitHub in one step.

These scripts are **not part of the learning material** and can be safely ignored by viewers or contributors exploring the code.
